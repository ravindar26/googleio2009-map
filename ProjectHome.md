We made an [interactive conference map](http://code.google.com/events/io/map/) for [Google I/O 2009](http://code.google.com/events/io/) using the [Google Maps API (JavaScript)](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/) and a little bit of Python for generating tiles.

Why not use some of our code and methods to make a similar map for your next conference?
